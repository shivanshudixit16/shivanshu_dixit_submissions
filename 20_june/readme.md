(Prepare a document of sample SQL queriesof above mentioned keywords)

Prepare your own table (with some constraints) in the DB you've created, share the document with CREATE TABLE query and screenshot of table created.

Describe the interfaces that make up the core of the JDBC API including the Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces and their relationship to provider implementations. (prepare a document with sample JDBC code)
Identify the components required to connect to a database using the DriverManager class including the JDBC URL
Submit queries and read results from the database including creating statements, returning result sets, iterating through the results, and properly closing result sets, statements, and connections


Implementation

I have prepared document on the queries of sql and jdbc
I have also made certain programs executing queries using java
